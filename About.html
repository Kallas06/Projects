<h3><center>Who are "The Used"?</center></h3>
<br>
<br>
<p>In January 2001, a group of guys from Orem, Utah came together and formed this American (alternative) rock band. The members of the group now are vocalist Bert McCracken, bassist Jeph Howard, drummer Dan Whitesides, and guitarist Joey Bradford.</p>
<p>Before they became who they are today, former members along with current held auditions at Howard's home for a vocalist. They had music already prepared, but lacked lyrics and a singer. McCracken was asked to audition and after being given music that band had written, he wrote the lyrics to what would become "Maybe Memories". Throughout all of this, the band members suffered from poverty, homelessness, and substance abuse, begging for change in order to buy food. The name of the band actually came from friends claiming they felt "used" when contact with the band members waned as they became more involved in the making of music. The founder of the band loved the way McCracken could scream and as soon as he auditioned, he was recording songs in his closet. After writing music together, they sent some of their songs to producer John Feldmann from the ska group Goldfinger. Upon hearing "A Box Full of Sharp Objects", Feldman flew them to L.A. on his own behalf and helped them find a record label.
<p>In June 2002, they signed with Reprise Records after sending demo copies to a plethora of record companies. They also learned that a Boston band had already trademarked "Used", so they stuck "the" in front of it and became who we know them today as "The Used".</p>
<p>Feldmann produced their self-titled debut album and it released on June 25, 2002. All three songs, "Blue and Yellow", "The Taste of Ink", and "Buried Myself Alive" entered the charts and certified the album being platinum. They went on to play Warped Tour, Ozzfest, Projekt Revolution, and Box Car Racer's first and last tour. The band received much recognition when McCracken dated Kelly Osbourne and appeared on an episode of The Osbournes. They later went on to released a compilation CD/DVD titled Maybe Memories. It consisted of live, rare, unreleased tracks, demo material, band history, bios, and some of a live concert. Maybe Memories has been certified platinum.</p>
<p>In 2004, McCracken's ex-girlfriend died of a drug overdose while pregnant with his child. Their second studio album, "In Love and Death", was released in reference to the tragedy dealt with while recording. This album received very positive reviews and earned their first MuchMusic Videa Award nomination. This album too has been certified platinum. They toured internationally then took less than a year off before starting to work on their next album.</p>
<p>On September 12, 2006, the band announced that a founding member, Branden Steineckert, was no longer a member due to a personality conflict with another member. Later that year, Dan Whitesides replaced him, and Steineckert has since joined Rancid.</p>
<p>On February 6, 2007, they released a live album titled "Berth". This included a DVD that features video performances at the Taste of Chaos 2005 tour in Vancouver. Also on the DVD was a biography of the band and four music videos. The biography tells of the band after they released Maybe Memories leading into the creation of In Love and Death. This release was certified gold. They released Lies for the Liars, their third album, on May 22, 2007. They headlined at Give It a Name festival, then in June played the MuchMusic Video Awards for the first time. They were scheduled to play Warped Tour in June and July, but had to cancel due to McCracken's vocal cord surgery. They continued to tour after he recovered.</p>
<p>May 19, 2008, they released Shallow Believer digitally. This was an EP that charted to No. 14 on iTunes' Top 100 albums. Throughout 2008 they worked on their fourth album, Artwork, who was produced by Panic! at the Disco's producer Matt Squire making it the first studio album not produced by John Feldmann. After it's release, a cover of "Burning Down the House" by the Talking Heads was released and was also featured in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen - The Album". They continued to tour and played The Bamboozle in May 2009. Their album Artwork became available worldwide on August 31, 2009. The band played a major U.S. tour in October and November 2009 with supporting bands The Almost, Drive A, and then another in early 2010 with Atreyu and Drive A. They later joined an arena tour supporting Three Days Grace in Canada. In April 2010, they began another U.S. tour along with Chiodos and New Medicine. (met these guys, really cool)</p>
<p>In 2011 they founded their own record label after parting ways with Reprise Records. The label was dubbed "Dental Records" then later changed to Anger Music Group. In May and June 2012 they made it to the main stage at Warped Tour.</p>
<p>In 2015, the band announced that founding member and guitarist Quinn Allman were parting ways. He was replaced by Saosin's guitarist, Justin Shekoski. They continued to tour in the U.S. and internationally in 2016. They released their seventh studio album, The Canyon, on October 27, 2017. In 2018, Shekoski was removed from the band and Joey Bradford became a replacement. After all of this, they signed with a new record label called Big Noise Music Group. They headlined the first annual Rockstar energy drink Disrupt tour, which was intended to be a void filler by the ending of Warped Tour. The album Heartwork, produced by John Feldmann was released April 24, 2020. In addition to the new album, the band plans to release another within a year.</p>
<p>The Used's music has been described as emo, post-hardcore, punk rock, screamo, alternative rock, hard rock, and heavy metal. McCracken described their genre as "gross pop".</p>
