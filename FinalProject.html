<p><p style="width: 1500px">I personally would like to say welcome to the site. You will easily find information about the band, ways to see them, hear their music, and so on.</p></p>

<p><p style="width: 1500px">I have listened to The Used since my early high school years. I hate aging myself, but that is about twenty years. Their music hasn't changed like other musicians tend to do. They have evolved but never strayed from their alternative selves. I fell in love with this band, and I hope you do too. I even have their used heart symbol tattooed on me twice.</p></p>

<p><p style="width: 1500px">So click away and indulge yourself into one of the most iconic alternative bands still around today!</p></p>
